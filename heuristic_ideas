define bridge mass BM as:
  BM = i_n + i_k
where i is the value of the island n and k consecutively
REMARK: if i_n = 1, then i_k cannot be 1.

then, the puzzle mass PM can be described as the sum of all BMs in the puzzle
// considering changing 'PM' shortcut due to recent inconveniences

Therefore, the algorithm should try to maximize PM value (intuition of connecting biggest islands*)
*TODO: mathematical explanation?
