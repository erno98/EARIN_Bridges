IDEA 1: Representing the game as a NxN table?
0 means no island, 1,2,... means the number on the island
example:
3 0 0 0 0 2 0
0 3 0 2 0 0 0
4 0 2 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 2 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 2 0 1
v - one vertical bridge
V - two vertical bridges
h - one horizontal bridge
H - two horizontal bridges

PROBLEM: numpy arrays don't support strigs/characters. Bridges should be shown as:
         11 - one vertical bridge
         12 - two vertical bridges
         21 - one horizontal bridge
         22 - two horizontal bridges
        

In the program: board state saved as:
         1. Numpy array representing the board
         2. List of islands consisting of:
                  a) x, y coordinates
                  b) number of expected bridges
                  c) number of current bridges
                  d) list of id's of connected islands - for checking if the graph is connected
         3. Bool - Solved or not
         
Maybe instead of the array add count of bridges in each direction (N, S, E, W) to the list of islands and try to work it from that?
