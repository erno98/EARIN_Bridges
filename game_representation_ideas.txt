IDEA 1: Representing the game as a NxN table?
0 means no island, 1,2,... means the number on the island
example:
3 0 0 0 0 2 0
0 3 0 2 0 0 0
4 0 2 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 2 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 2 0 1
v - one vertical bridge
V - two vertical bridges
h - one horizontal bridge
H - two horizontal bridges

PROBLEM: numpy arrays don't support strigs/characters. Bridges shown as floats?
         1.1 - one vertical bridge
         1.2 - two vertical bridges
         2.1 - one horizontal bridge
         2.2 - two horizontal bridges
