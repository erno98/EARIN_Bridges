- ## Before coding
  - ### Formal description of the puzzle
      - Puzzle environment
      - Describing the puzzle as a graph?
      - Rules
  - ### Design of the search space
    - Description of the puzzle space
    - Models of the search & puzzle spaces
    - Relations between puzzle and search spaces
  - ### Uninformed search
    - ?
  - ### Informed search
    - Design of the heuristic function
      - Admissable and monotonic?
    - Cost function?

- ## Coding
  - ### Puzzle implementation
    - Puzzle space implementation
    - Search space implementation
  - ### Unit tests (TDD)?
  - ### Heuristic (and cost?) function implementation

- ## After coding
  - ### Performance tests
    - Algorithm comparison
      - Number of states visited by each algorithm
      - Computation time
    - Code efficiency
      - Computation time
  - ### Optimization
